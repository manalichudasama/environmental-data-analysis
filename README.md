# Environmental Data Analysis

This repository documents my hands-on learning and practice in:

- Environmental engineering
- Sustainability and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
- Data analysis and quantitative modelling using Excel and Python

The focus is on **transparent, structured, and reproducible environmental analysis**.

## Objectives
- Strengthen fundamentals in environmental data analysis
- Apply quantitative methods to sustainability and LCA-related problems
- Build a clear and practical project portfolio

## Tools
- Excel (data structuring, calculations, indicators)
- Python (pandas, matplotlib – beginner level)
- GitHub for documentation and version control

## Status
Work in progress. Projects will be added progressively.
